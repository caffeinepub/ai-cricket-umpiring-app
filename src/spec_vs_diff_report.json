  "summary": "Diff implements several UI/runtime fixes aligned with the glitch-fix request (branding update to \"MR.AI UMPIRE\", theme toggle handling for system theme, interval/object-URL cleanup to mitigate timer/memory leaks), but some requirements—especially around removing/implementing placeholder components and comprehensive end-to-end QA outcomes—cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary. The diff also introduces a number of unrequested stylistic/feature-like changes and a new project_state.json file.",

      "requirement": "Perform an end-to-end QA pass of the app (camera/recording, upload, analysis playback, theme toggle, navigation/back flow) and fix any runtime errors, broken UI states, or obvious regressions found during manual testing.",
      "reason": "While there are targeted fixes (interval cleanup in AnalysisView and object URL cleanup/back flow handling in App), the diff summary does not provide evidence that the full end-to-end QA acceptance criteria were verified (e.g., \"App loads without console errors\" in logged-out and post-Internet Identity login flows; full record/upload→analysis→back flow without blank screens across the app).",

      "reason": "The diff summary mentions many component modifications and additions, but it does not show any explicit removal or implementation of previously empty placeholder component files, nor does it identify which placeholders existed and were addressed.",
